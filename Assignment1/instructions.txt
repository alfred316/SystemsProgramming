cp1 takes two directories as arguments, so after comiling it using 'cc -o cp1 cp1.c' 
use './cp1 srcDir/ tgtDir/' to test it. Only the srcDir/ needs to exist, as the code
will create a new directory as a target if one does not exist. Both need to be specified.
srcDir/ included in submittion with a test text file inside

who1 will work without arguments, giving the details from the utmp file
compiled 'cc -o who1 who1.c' and runs with './who1'

who4 will either take an argument and use the wtmp file (if argument is /var/log/wtmp)
or will take no argument and behave just like who1
compile: 'cc -o who4 who4.c' run: './who4 /var/log/wtmp' or './who4'
